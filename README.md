# ForFunProjects

A neat little folder for some of the random python things I've done over the years. 
Since the very beginning, I've encountered random problems and puzzles where I've felt inspired to write some code.
Some of these files are pointless, some are powerful. Feel free to have some fun.
This collection will never stop growing :)
Began sometime in summer of 2020
Recent as of April 2023
